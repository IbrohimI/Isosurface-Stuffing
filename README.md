# Isosurface-Stuffing

In this program, you can feed the program with any two dimensional object, and the program will simulate the same shape but with uniformly sized triangular mesh. This is important in computational geometry when one wants to calculate the objects physical properties such as elasticity, displacement and etc. This becomes important in industrial constructions.
After running the source code, it will display the output for the case of triangular meshing of a circle.
Along with your favorite IDE, gnuplot package should be installed in the local PC.
